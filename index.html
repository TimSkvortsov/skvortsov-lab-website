<p>Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. Despite being first described over a century ago and playing key role in some of the biggest discoveries in biology, bacteriophages remain a relatively unexplored and underutilised resource. We believe that bacteriophages have a great potential to be used in the treatment of bacterial infections, especially resistant to antimicrobials, as well as in biotechnology and in many other economically important areas.</p>

<p>We want to see a future where the full potential of bacteriophages is realised and they are used to improve the quality of life of people in Northern Ireland and around the world. To achieve this, we are working on the development of novel bacteriophage-based pharmaceutical formulations, as well as on the characterisation of bacteriophages and their enzymes using a combination of computational and experimental approaches.</p>

<p>We are open to collaborations and are always happy to discuss new ideas. If you have a project in mind that you think we might be interested in, please get <a href="/contact">in touch with us</a>. We would be particlularly interested in projects invovling genetic engineering of bacteriophages and their enzymes, bioinformatics analysis of viral genomes and metagenomic datasets, and synthetic microbiology projects.</p>

<p>We are developing several novel formulations for bacteriophage delivery, including liposomes, microneedles and deep eutectic solvents. We are also exploring the potential of using bacteriophages in combination with other antimicrobial agents and conducting computational studies to identify novel bacteriophage enzymes with biotechnological potential.</p>
